# Lab 4

Welcome to Garret's Library! Instead of doing a blog site I did a library with some nested JSON. You can Create a book, Read the book, Update the book, and Update the book! What comes with any book? Pages! In each book there is a nested JSON array of pages which you can update as you see fit! Each page serves as a miniturae book where you can store anything you're heart desires.

## What Worked Well
- Design  
- Redux
- API Calls

## What Didn't
- Nested JSON was such a headache
- Nested Routers were really annoying

## Extra Credit
- As mentioned, instead of a making a simple blog site I made a Library. Nested JSON was used in the content section allowing users to create collections of posts all together in a pretty nifty way.
